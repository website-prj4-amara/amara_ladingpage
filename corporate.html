              For our color pallete we chose bright contrasting colors, that ctreate a dymanic and bold look, which coresponds with our values. The bright pink is bold and attracts attention, where as the softer pink is more gentle and feminine, which speaks to our audience. Since we chose to target older mothers, we opted to have deep greens and dark brown in our palette as well - both colors are still bright, but are more grounded and mature, which better suits our older target audience. Our color palette creates a nice balance between bright bold colors that speak to our brand values and vision, while simultaniously being grounding and feminine fitting our target audience.

            <li>Font choices - Jeanne Moderno OT Geometrique ( from ADOBE fonts) - this font is used for headings and accents. It is bold and attracts attention, and reflects the values our brand shares by being out there and creative. 
				<br>Proxima Nova Medium (from ADOBE fonts) - this font is used for the main body text of the website, it's more simple than the other font making the content easily readable, making the text easy to interpret and doesn't overwhelm the consumer.</li>
            <li>User interface patterns: <br>
				We use a navigation bar on all the pages at the top, which makes it easy for the user to see all of the pages  our website has, as well as giving them an option to switch between the pages that they want to view.<br>
				The carousel on the home page is intended to attact the attention of the user as soon as they open the website. It showcases the products/services that we want to offer to our consumer, providing them the information on what we offer as soon as they open the page.<br>
				We use cards on the 'Support us' page in order to make the different tiers of donation stand out more and attract more attention to the 'donate' buttons on the site. <br>
				The buttons that we use troughout the website are in a bright color(to attarct attention of the user) and rounded style, switching to white when you drag the cursor onto the button, which is done in order to improve the user experience and showcase the functionality of the button.<br>
				The pop-up windows on the 'support us'  page provide a simple layout to the consumer on how to donate money to our cause, making it easy to navigate.<br> 
				The overall layout of the website is simple and uses the grid system to seperate the content in order to make it as simple to navigate and explore as possible to the consumer. 
			  </li>
            <li>The structure of the <strong>navigation and content</strong> (e.g. how content units are distributed across pages)<br>
			  On the homepage there is the carousel straight away showcasing the products that we want to offer, followed by 2 segments that provide information about 'who we are' and how you can 'support us' with the option to get rederected to the page where you can find out more about the topic of your choice on the corresponding page by clicking on the buttons 'read more'. This was done in order to not owershelm the user when they open the website, and provide them just enough information to attract their attention to our content. <br>
				On the 'about us' page the content is distributed into sections with headers indicating what the following text will be about. The entire page provides the user the information about our values, our vision and who we are as a team and as a brand. It is accompanied with illustrations making the experience more fun for the user.<br>
				On the 'support us' content is once again distrubuted into sections to make in easy to navigate for the consumer. The general information of our cause and why we need support comes first so the user isnt confused to what they're donating the money. The different donation tiers and their rewards are also divided into 3 separate cards, so that the consumer can see the clear distinction between the tiers.

          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
			<p> See appendix 4 for the full Marketing report</p>
          <p>a. We are a team that focuses on empowering mothers and demolishing the scrutiny they face on a daily basis. We believe that women should be unashamed of the choices that they make and strive to be the most authentic version of themselves. Being a mother can be challenging and demanding, so we want women to not forget to take time for themselves. You can provide the best example for your kids and teach them the value of self-care, by being the best version of yourself. Our ultimate goal at Amara is to build a community of women and moms who feel supported and celebrated in their position as parents. We hope to accomplish this by connecting with our target audience on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram and creating a safe area where mothers can share their experiences, learn from one another, and feel confident in their parenting abilities. Our objectives T create a sense of community and connection among your audience, we will be sharing our value proposition regarding our monthly workshops and day care. We will be sharing the concept of the workshops and what the topics of the workshops will be. We will simultaneously be asking our audience if they like the idea and what workshops would they like to attend. Doing this we will ensure to have engagement with our audience and also get insight on what would they like to see from us.  Our objectives regarding reaching a certain amount of Facebook and Instagram users directly links to our goal of increasing our brand awareness. Moreover, our objectives regarding making mother feel less judged and shamed  directly link to our goal of creating a community of mothers where they can feel safe and uplift each other. </p>
          <p>b.	Our promotional activities include creating Instagram and  Facebook accounts where we focused on connecting with our audience. We had a media schedule with planned posts to post weekly. We initially focused on introducing our audience to our topic of creating a community of mother who have experienced shaming by posting real stories of mothers. Then we focused on introducing our audience to our value proposition, being the Amara workshops, where they can meet monthly and focus on uplifting each other. We generated engagement by asking for their opinions and feedback on the idea as well as encouraging them to share stories of their struggles as mothers.  </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>a.	When starting this project we were very excited to embark on this journey, considering no one has created a brand before. We were excited for making the big decision regarding the identity and the goal of the brand. However, we soon realized how responsible and serious the project was and fear if we would actually succeed started kicking in. </p>
			<p>b.	When creating our objectives we wanted to base them on research and be as realistic as possible. Therefore, we had an objective of reaching 50 users on Instagram by the 10th of April. We are happy to say the we succeeded in reaching the objective. We even went over it by reaching 95 users. We believe we blame that on the fact that we were very active on Instagram thought the project. We made sure to post frequently, create posts that fit our tone of voice and goal and engage with our audience. The only thing we could have done better we would say is stick more to the schedule, since sometimes we would not post exactly on the day and time we agreed on. To conclude, we learned that in order to be successful with your Instagram business page, you have to make sure that you really know your target audience and post according to their needs and interest. Another very big thing to mention is being authentic and open about struggles. </p>
			<p>c.	We had a Facebook objective of reaching 30 users by the 10th of April. Unfortunately, we didn’t reach our objective. Although, we posted the exact same posts and stories on Facebook as we did on Instagram, we only reached 11 users. We believe that the mistake we made in not researching enough our target audiences’ behavior on the platform. Looking back now, we would do a lot of things differently. For example, we would try to find a better way to position our brand on the media and look into what our target audience likes and follows. Moreover, now we would alter the posts and stories a little bit more so their not the same as the ones on Instagram. We learned that Facebook and Instagram are two very different platforms and they should be treated differently because if you treat them the same (as we did), one of them will always be unsuccessful.</p>
			<p>d.	Based on our insights our objective of making women and mothers feel more confident and experience less pressure/shame about their parenting by creating a community on our social media where the can freely express themselves was quiet successful as well. We posted very frequently stride of mother being shamed and encouraged other women to do so as well. Consequently, we received many stories of mothers being shamed for their parenting, which we then went on to share on our profiles. We also gained quite some followers likes and shares on our post for empowering women. These insights show as that we made a change in women’s behavior and now they are encourage to uplift couther and not the opposite. </p>
			<p>e.	What we expected from the project was to be interesting and exciting but also challenging in terms of organization and keeping deadlines. As it turns out, it was indeed that. However, what we didn’t expect was how many things we would have to do simultaneously. For example, we all had to work on production, marketing, management and content all at the same time. Of course, we couldn’t organize ourselves to do so and made some compromises where we divided tasks and focus only on one thing at a time. Looking back, we would definitely change that and make sure everyone is equally involved in everything to make sure for optimal results. </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>a.	So far we have successfully created our brand Amara. We successfully targeted our audience and reached them on our social media accounts. We established connection by sharing stories to which they can relate and connect with one another. Moreover, we shared our value proposition with our audience and received positive feedback and suggestions about the idea. If the project were to continue we would do a lot of new things:<br>
i.	For starters we would start executing our workshops start posting videos and photos of how the workshops are going<br>
ii.	We would seek influencers who match our target audience and collaborate with them. We would invite them to our workshops and ask them to vlog their experience. That way the following of the said influence would get familiar with Amara and possibly become a member.<br>
iii.	We would extend our media presence by going on even more platforms like Tik Tok. We would segment our audience there ad start posting videos of our workshops and what we at Amara stand for.<br> 
iv.	We would do research where our target group spends a lot of their time a incorporate some offline marketing. <br>
v.	So far, our marketing has been focused only in The Netherlands, however if we were to continue the project we would start focusing on promotion all over Europe. To succeed in that we will get in contact with influencers and marketing experts throughout all Europe. </p>
          <p>b.	In conclusion, we are proud of what we have done with Amara, so far, however if we had the chance to implement all these changes and new ideas we believe that we could elevate the Amara brand to a very high level and create a really strong women community worldwide. </p>

          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Cost structure</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Fixed: Rooms for workshops; staff salary; legal fees
				Variable: materials<br></li>
            <li>Calculate the cost per unit: <br>
			  Cost per unit per month calculated in the Netherlands (Yoga): <br>
To calculate the cost per unit we make use for the following formula the direct costing: <br>
(The costs are calculated for 2 hours for 20 persons and the workshops are twice per month) <br>
Cost Per Unit = Total Fixed Cost + Variable costs / The Number of the Units produced <br> 
Total Fixed Cost (Appendix) =  <br>
Room Workshop + Staff +  Legal Insurance <br>
Workshop Room = 61 euro’s for part of the day <br>
61*2= 122 euro’s 2 lessons (per month)  <br>
Yoga Staff = 35*2= 70 (2 hours) <br>
70*2= 140 euro’s 2 lessons (per month)  <br>
Legal Insurance= 26,25 euro’s (per month)  <br>
Total Fixed Costs = 122 +140 +26,25  <br>
= 288,25 euro’s <br>
Variable Cost (Appendix) =  <br>
Materials:  <br>
Yoga mat = 3*100/79= 3,80 inclusive BTW (20 persons) <br>
3,80 * 20 =76 euro’s <br>
76*2= 152 euro’s for 2 lessons (1month) <br>
Total Variable Costs = 152 euro’s per month <br>
The Number of the Units produced (Chapter 6) = <br>
20 persons per lesson and twice per month = 40 persons(units) <br>
40 * 30 (usage fee) = 1200 euro’s per month <br>
25*20= 300 (Subscription) = 500 euro’s per month <br>
Cost per Unit with only usage fees  = (288,25 + 152) / 1200 per month = 0.36 euro <br>
Cost per Unit with only subscriptions = (288,25 + 152) / 500 per month = 0.88 euro<br> 
</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fw-bold">Services/products</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The workshop we offer falls under two different topics/themes: the first topic is teamwork. This is specifically aimed at improving the bond between the mothers. These are classes where you work together and connect with each other. Think about this when talking to each other, the ‘’problem-round’’ think about this that the mothers indicate what they find difficult and are ashamed of. <br>

The second subject/theme we offer are active lessons. These are classes where mothers get started with exercises. The active lessons we offer now consist of psychological part; yoga, meditation and breathing exercises. We really tackle the mindfulness part here. <br>

Other themes that we offer in the active lessons are; dancing, painting and cooking. These are all the themes we offer for the mothers. The workshop is intended to physically go and improve contact with each other. When you arrive at the workshop, the contact will be used in the first fifteen minutes. In this, the mothers talk to each other and the last things are put down for the given subject. Then a ninety minute lesson is given on the topic chosen for the day. Finally, there is still fifteen minutes left and the mothers will talk to each other about what the workshop or home is like. <br>

The workshop has to do with our unique value proposition, because our values that Amara stands for are; shamelessness, self-love, confidence and authenticity. The lessons we teach are meant to make the mother less shameless about her decisions. In addition, the mothers must embrace their imperfections, be unapologetic and feel authentic. This works because accepting yourself through classes such as meditation and yoga addresses this problem. In short, the lessons taught add value to the way you parent. Everyone does it in their own way and that is the right way for everyone. This is what we want to bring to our workshop. You don't have to be ashamed of the decisions you make. No one is perfect and that's why it's okay to be yourself. This can be done by participating in our workshop, because that ensures that the mothers can be their true selves. They can then take this home and be able to arm themselves and her own way of parenting. The name Amara comes from the Latin word everlasting and to love someone respectfully. This is in line with our company, because we stand for yourself and can unarm yourself. That is Amara loving yourself, each other and everyone. Don't be afraid of the choices you make and that's why it fits in with our brand identity. <br>

          </ul>

          <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
          <p>If we are going to reflect on why we made the choice of our trademark. First, we divide the difference between what it is based on here. First, we look at how we differentiate ourselves in terms of our name ''Amara''. This was deliberately chosen so that the name exudes what we stand for. This is love for yourself and others, because that is our value we want to bring. When we go to look at our logo, it was chosen because we want to exude the authentic and we have done that by choosing a font that not everyone can agree with. The font reflects that some like it and others don't. Because you have to be able to be yourself and it doesn't matter what others think of it you have to be shameless. The font reflects that because this is a font that is itself despite what others like about it. The colors strike back at the cup of love which we think is important.<br> 

Analysis of the existing alternatives by our interviews and research: <br>
The alternatives we had found were; journaling, online resourcing, therapist and self-care. The pattern we found here is that you have to take the big step yourself. People find things harder to do on your own than together. This was also shown in the interviews. ‘’Besides, when you use online resources, you are never sure if they are reliable. You never know who wrote it’’ was said in our interview. What we have also analyzed is that when you search the internet about your problems you always come across the worst there is. Therefore, these are uncertain factors and especially if you have no one to support you. Mothers lack the support to solve problems together. By comparing this with each other, we found a pattern and that is that all these problems are not collectively discussable. <br>
